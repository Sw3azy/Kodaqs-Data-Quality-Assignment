# COVID-19 Mobility Analysis: Modern Tools & Workflows Assignment

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between human mobility patterns and COVID-19 case trends in the United States during 2021. Using publicly available data, we perform descriptive analyses and regression modeling to understand how different types of mobility (retail, grocery, parks, workplaces, etc.) correlate with COVID-19 cases.

## Research Questions

1.  How do different mobility patterns relate to COVID-19 case counts?
2.  Is there a weekend effect in COVID-19 case reporting?
3.  Do lagged mobility patterns predict future case counts?
4.  Which mobility factors are most strongly associated with transmission?

## Requirements

### Software

-   R (\>= 4.0.0)
-   RStudio (recommended)
-   Quarto (for rendering the report)

### R Packages

``` r
tidyverse (>= 2.0.0)
here (>= 1.0.0)
zoo (>= 1.8.0)
scales (>= 1.3.0)
patchwork (>= 1.2.0)
quarto (>= 1.4)
```

Full package versions are documented in `docs/session_info.txt`

## How to Run

### Option 1: Run All Analyses (Recommended)

``` bash
# In terminal/Git Bash
bash run.sh
```

This will: 1. Install required packages 2. Load and process data 3. Generate descriptive statistics and plots 4. Run regression analyses 5. Create the final HTML report

### Option 2: Run Individual Scripts

``` r
# In R/RStudio
source("code/01_setup.R")
source("code/02_descriptive_analysis.R")
source("code/03_regression_analysis.R")

# Render report
quarto::quarto_render("code/04_report.qmd")
```

## Key Findings

-   **Multiple regression** (R² = 0.30) shows grocery/pharmacy mobility increases cases while retail and parks decrease cases

-   **Indoor vs outdoor:** Grocery shopping (indoor) shows highest transmission risk; parks (outdoor) are protective

-   **Weekend effect:** Cases reported on weekends are \~17 lower (p \< 0.001) due to reporting lag

-   **Predictive power:** Lagged mobility patterns show weak predictive power (R² \< 0.01), suggesting concurrent rather than causal relationship
